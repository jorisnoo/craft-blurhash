**Render a BlurHash from a given asset in Craft CMS.**

A [BlurHash](https://blurha.sh/) is a compact representation of a placeholder for an image. A blurred version of an image, useful for displaying whilst the full resolution image is loading.

## Requirements

* Craft CMD 3.x
* GD / ImageMagick (*as required by Craft CMS*)

## Installation

Install the plugin as follows:

1. Open your terminal and go to your Craft project:

        cd /path/to/project

2. Then tell Composer to load the plugin:

        composer require github.com/dodecastudio/craft-blurhash

3. In the Control Panel, go to Settings ‚Üí Plugins and click the ‚ÄúInstall‚Äù button for BlurHash.

## BlurHash Overview

The BlurHash plugin will generate a BlurHash image from a craft asset. Here's an example of what you can expect:

### Input:
<img src="resources/img/example-01-photo.jpg" width="512" />

### Result:
<img src="resources/img/example-01-blurhash.jpg" width="512" />

## Using BlurHash

### Common use

To use the plugin, first grab an asset from Craft, perhaps something like this:

```twig
{% set testAsset = craft.assets().id(101).one() %}
```

You can then pass your asset to the plugin's `blurhash` function, which will return a blurhash image as a data-url, perfect for using in an `img` element like so:

```twig
<img src="{{ blurhash(testAsset) }}" width="{{testAsset.width}}" height="{{testAsset.height}}" />
```

### Other features

#### Generating a blurhash string

If you just want to generate just a blurhash string from a given asset, you can use the `blurhash` filter like this:

```twig
{{ testAsset|blurhash }}
```

Which will return something like this:

```
twigK-I#.3ofof_4ofj[%Mayay
```

You might want to store this in some way, for use later.

#### Generating a blurhash image from a blurhash string

If you already have a blurhash string and want to generate an image from it, you can use the `blurhashToUri` function like this:

```twig
<img src="{{ blurhashToUri('K-I#.3ofof_4ofj[%Mayay') }}" width="256" height="256" alt="Blurhash image" />
```
