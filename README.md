**Render a BlurHash from a given asset in Craft CMS.**

A [BlurHash](https://blurha.sh/) is a compact representation of a placeholder for an image. A blurred version of an image, useful for displaying whilst the full resolution image is loading.

This plugin uses kornrunner's PHP implementation of BlurHash, [php-blurhash](https://github.com/kornrunner/php-blurhash).

## Requirements

- Craft CMD 3.x
- PHP 7.3 or higher
- GD / ImageMagick (_as required by Craft CMS_)

## Installation

Install the plugin as follows:

1.  Open your terminal and go to your Craft project:

        cd /path/to/project

2.  Then tell Composer to load the plugin:

        composer require dodecastudio/craft-blurhash

3.  In the Control Panel, go to Settings ‚Üí Plugins and click the ‚ÄúInstall‚Äù button for BlurHash.

## BlurHash Overview

The BlurHash plugin will generate a BlurHash image from a craft asset. Here's an example of what you can expect:

### Input:

<img src="resources/img/example-01-photo.jpg" width="512" />

### Result:

<img src="resources/img/example-01-blurhash.jpg" width="512" />

## Using BlurHash

### Common use

To use the plugin, first grab an asset from Craft, perhaps something like this:

```twig
{% set testAsset = craft.assets().id(101).one() %}
```

You can then pass your asset to the plugin's `blurhash` function, which will return a blurhash image as a data-url, perfect for using in an `img` element like so:

```twig
<img src="{{ blurhash(testAsset) }}" width="{{testAsset.width}}" height="{{testAsset.height}}" />
```

### Other features

#### Generating a blurhash string

If you just want to generate just a blurhash string from a given asset, you can use the `blurhash` filter like this:

```twig
{{ testAsset|blurhash }}
```

Which will return something like this:

```twig
K-I#.3ofof_4ofj[%Mayay
```

You might want to store this in some way, for use later.

#### Generating a blurhash image from a blurhash string

If you already have a blurhash string and want to generate an image from it, you can use the `blurhashToUri` function like this:

```twig
<img src="{{ blurhashToUri('K-I#.3ofof_4ofj[%Mayay') }}" width="256" height="256" alt="Blurhash image" />
```

#### Returning average color for an image

BlurHash strings contain the average color for the image. You can decode this value from a BlurHash string and return it as a [Craft ColorData object](https://docs.craftcms.com/api/v3/craft-fields-data-colordata.html#public-properties).

```twig
{{ averageColor('K-I#.3ofof_4ofj[%Mayay') }}
{{ averageColor('K-I#.3ofof_4ofj[%Mayay').getRgb() }}
```

...or directly from an asset:

```twig
{{ testAsset|averageColor }}
{{ averageColor(testAsset) }}
{{ averageColor(testAsset).getRgb() }}
```

### GraphQL Support

As of v1.1.0 it's possible to use the plugin via Graph QL. The same functionality that's available with the Twig functions, is now available through Graph QL directives.

#### Returning a blurhash data URI from an asset field

An asset field can be returned as a dataURI to a blurhash image using the `@assetToBlurHash` directive. It can also be used to return a blurhash string by setting the `asUri` argument to `false`.

```graphql
{
  entries(section: "news") {
    title
    ... on news_article_Entry {
      asset {
        blurhashString: url @assetToBlurHash(asUri: false)
        blurhashUri: url @assetToBlurHash
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This will return some JSON which looks a bit something like this:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "entries": [
      {
        "title": "An important news item",
        "asset": [
          {
            "blurhashString": "K-I#.3ofof_4ofj[%Mayay",
            "blurhashUri": "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAEAAAAB..."
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### Rendering a blurhash image from a plaintext blurhash string

If you have a blurhash string saved in a Craft, you can render it to a data URI using the `@blurhashToUri` directive. In this example, there is a plaintext field called `blurhashStringField` stored in our news article entry.

```graphql
{
  entries(section: "news") {
    title
    blurhashStringField
    blurhashUri: blurhashStringField @blurhashToUri
  }
}
```

And that will then give us some JSON that looks a bit like this:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "entries": [
      {
        "title": "An important news item",
        "blurhashStringField": "K-I#.3ofof_4ofj[%Mayay",
        "blurhashUri": "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAEAAAAB..."
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### Getting an average color for an image

If you want to return the average color for an image saved in Craft, you can use the `@averageColor` directive. This returns a hex color value as a string.

```graphql
{
  entries(section: "news") {
    title
    ... on news_article_Entry {
      blurhashStringField @averageColor
      asset {
        averageColor: url @averageColor
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Which will return you some JSON like this:

```
{
  "data": {
    "entries": [
      {
        "title": "An important news item",
        "blurhashStringField": "#a3a696",
        "asset": [
          {
            "averageColor": "#817c82"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
